# httpc
A simple (perhaps a little too much) HTTP server written in C for Linux.

So far the server can only send HTML files as responses.

I know there probabily still are ways to make it crash, so if you find a way to trigger it, post an Issue detailing how the crash is achieved and I'll try to fix it.
